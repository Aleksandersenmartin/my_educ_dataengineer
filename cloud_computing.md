# What is Cloud computing ? 
Cloud computing is the delivery of technology services - including compute, storage, databases, networking, software, and many more - over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 

By using cloud computing, businesses and individuals can access and use IT resources on demand without having to own and manage physical hardware. 

### Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing. 
1. On-Demand Self Service
  - Users can provision computing resources like storage or processing power as needed without human intervention

2. Broad Network Access:
  - Resources are accessible over the internet from anywhere using devices like laptops, phones, or tablets

3. Resource Pooling:
   - Providers pool computing resources to serve multiple users (multi-tenancy) while ensuring security and isolation
  
4. Scalability and Elasticity:
   - Resources can be automatically scaled up or down based on demand
   - This ensure cost efficiency and high availability
  
5. Measured Service:
   - You pay for what you use, typically billed on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis.
  

### Types of Cloud Computing 
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
   - Provides basic infrastructure like virtual machines, storage, and networking
   - Example providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Microsoft Azure, Goodle Cloud Platform

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS):
   - Provides a platform for developers to build and deploy applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure
   - Example providers: Heroku, Goodle App Enine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
  
3. Software as a Service (SaaS):
   - Delivers software applications over the internet, typically on a subscription basis
   - Example providers: Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 3650
  
4. Function as a Service (FaaS) /Serverless Computing
   - Allows developers to run code without managing servers. Resources are automatically scaled and billed per execution
   - Example Providers: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions.
